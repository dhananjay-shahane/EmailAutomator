Workflow Overview
Extract email sender and body: Use Python’s built-in email library or tools like MCP to get the sender’s email address and the body content from incoming emails.

LLM intent detection: Pass the email body to an LLM (configured in MCP) to identify what script and tool are needed, as well as any additional resources (like LAS files).

Resource access: LLM calls MCP resources (mcp.recorses()) to access or preprocess the specified LAS file.

Script execution: Pass the LAS file to the required MCP script or tool as determined by LLM, then execute the script against the file.

Output image generation: The script generates a PNG output, which is saved in a dynamically created folder (named with a timestamp).

Send output: The generated PNG file is then attached and sent to the originating email address.

How Each Step Works
Extract Email Details
Use Python’s imaplib and email modules to fetch unread emails and extract “From” and body sections.

For multipart messages, focus on extracting the plain-text part for LLM processing.

Integrate with LLM via MCP
Pass the body text to the LLM endpoint or MCP toolkit.

The LLM determines needed script, LAS file, and tool based on email instructions (for example, “Analyze LAS file with tool XYZ”) and returns specifics.

Resource Handling
Use MCP functions (mcp.recorses()) to load or identify the target LAS file for processing―these might reside locally or be referenced via cloud storage.

Script Execution
The identified script (from LLM output) is called via MCP, ingesting the LAS file as an argument.

Script runs, reading data and generating its result—usually a plot/image.

Dynamic Output Saving
Use Python’s datetime module to create a unique timestamp-named folder.

Save the PNG output from script into this folder.

Email Output
Use Python’s smtplib or MCP tool to send email and attach generated images, using extracted sender’s email address.

Quick Python Code Structure Example
python
# 1) Extract email details (sender, body)
sender_email, body = get_email_details()  # Custom function using email/imaplib
# 2) Pass body to LLM for instruction extraction
script_name, las_file = llm_parse_email(body)
# 3) Load las file via MCP resources
las_data = mcp.recorses(las_file)
# 4) Execute script on LAS data and generate PNG
output_png = mcp.tool(script_name, las_data)
# 5) Save to timestamp folder
folder = make_timestamp_folder()
save_png(output_png, folder)
# 6) Send result PNG to email sender
send_email_with_attachment(sender_email, output_png)
Each step uses standard modules and MCP integration routines.

The LLM’s output must clearly specify which script/tool and LAS file to use, so prompt engineering for your LLM is essential.

For sending emails with attachments, smtplib plus email.mime modules can be used.

This architecture can be adapted to your MCP server and toolchain for seamless automation.
